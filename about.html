            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Reffy Dian Pratama. I am a graphic designer with 5 years of experience in the field. Since I was young,
                I have had a passion for creativity and visual aesthetics. I always enjoyed spending time drawing, painting, and experimenting with various art forms.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Beyond my technical abilities, I am known for my collaborative spirit and ability to understand clients' needs. I believe in building strong relationships with my clients, working closely with
                them to bring their visions to life. My attention to detail, creativity, and commitment to delivering high-quality designs have earned recognition and praise from both clients and colleagues.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I continue to explore new design techniques and mediums, always seeking to push the boundaries of my creativity.
                I firmly believe in lifelong learning and actively participate in design workshops and conferences to stay inspired and connected with the design community.
            </p>
